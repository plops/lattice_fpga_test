the example in arachne is using the following settings.
set_io D1 99
set_io D2 98
set_io D3 97
set_io D4 96
set_io D5 95
set_io clk 21

the board i have has different connections:
http://www.latticesemi.com/view_document?document_id=50373
on this board the following connections to fpga (I got this from LED_pin.pcf):
# Family & Device:    iCE40HX8K
# Package:            CT256
set_io LED3 A2
set_io LED7 B3
set_io clk J3
set_io LED2 B4
set_io LED4 A1
set_io LED6 C4
set_io LED8 C3
set_io LED1 B5
set_io LED5 C5



In SPI Peripheral Mode the SPI signals loads the program file into the
CRAM (configuration ram) of the FPGA directly. In this mode the FPGA
will lose its configuration when power is removed and must be
re-configured. Jumpers must be in locations J6:1-2 and J6:3-4. Jumper
J7 is not installed. See Figure 5. LED in location D10 is connected to
the CDONE pin of the iCE40HX-8K. This can be monitored to determine
that the iCE40HX-8K is programmed correctly.
